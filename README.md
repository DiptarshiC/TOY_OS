#About this project


I have been reading about operating systems code and have for longed aspired to write my own operating systems.
It is a daunting and time consuming task I know, but atleast I have to start somewhere. I am first familiarizing 
myself with bits and pieces. I believe it starts with first understanding how the BIOS works and then moving on
to more complicated things. 

I shall start writing some BIOS calls for an X86 processor using QEMU emulator. Later I shall move on writing to
a bit more complex things. This is not a one day project, and shall take some time. I am giving myself some time
for it to come up. Wish me luck on this journey of learning.
